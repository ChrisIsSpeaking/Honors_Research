# gen-HyBR
This repository contains MATLAB files for generalized hybrid iterative methods.  The codes accompany the paper: 

"Generalized Hybrid Iterative Methods for Large-Scale Bayesian Inverse Problems" - Chung and Saibaba, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 2017

# Requirements
These codes require the following packages:
         
         Regularization Tools package: Hansen. Regularization tools: A
             package for analysis and solution of discrete ill-posed 
             problems. Numerical Algorithms, 1994.
             
         RestoreTools package: Nagy, Palmer, and Perrone. Iterative 
             Methods for image deblurring: A Matlab object oriented 
             approach. Numerical Algorithms, 2004.
