To run these examples, you first need to set search paths to
the codes in RestoreTools.  This can be done by running the
script startup.m

The most recent version of RestoreTools has two new features:

1. psfPrec 
   Has been updated to compute an approximate SVD preconditioner.
   In most cases this preconditioner works much better than the
   old (ciculant) one, which has been renamed fftPrec.
2. HyBR
   This is a new iterative method that implements a hybrid Lanczos
   bidiagonalization/Tikhonov regularization method.  Default
   regularization parameters and stopping criteria are chosen for
   the user.  See reference [1] below.

An illustration of the basic computations is in:

  basic_computations.m

Several example using HyBR can be found in:

  HyBR_examples.m

The mfiles example_xpy.m correspond to the examples from [2], where
the original version of these codes is described.
