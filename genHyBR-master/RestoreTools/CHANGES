  1. Added Lisa's codes (with some slight cosmetic modifications)
     to do Kronecker product approximations for reflexive boundary
     conditions.  This includes:
     (a) Modified Classes/@psfMatrix/kronApprox.m to look for
         zero, reflexive or neumann boundary conditions.
     (b) Added the following functions to Classes/@psfMatrix/private/
         * zeroKronApprox.m (this replaces zeroSepApprox.m)
         * reflexKronApprox.m
         * buildHank.m
  2. Fixed some problems with TSVD.m and GCVforTSVD.m

* 6/02/02, J. Nagy
  1. Added new class, transformMatrix, to be used for direct
     methods.
  2. Modifed Classes/@psfMatrix/svd.m to compute "SVD" for 
     various boundary conditions.  The following new functions
     were added to Classes/@psfMatrix/private/
       kron_svd.m (for zero boundary conditions, and reflexive boundary
                   conditions with nonsymmetric PSF)
       fft_svd.m  (for periodic boundary conditions)
       dct_svd.m  (for reflexive boundary conditions with symmetric PSF)
  3. Modified TSVD so that it will work for various boundar conditions.

* 6/6/02, J. Nagy
  1. Added function DirectMethods/Tikhonov.m 
     (Replaces DirectMethods TLS.m from version 1.0)
     Tikhonov should now work for various boundary conditions, and
     in some cases the derivative regularization operator can be used.
     Also had to modify DirectMethods/GCVfun.m and givensDLS.m

* 10/10/02, J. Nagy
  1. Fixed a small bug in Classes/@psf/size.m

* 11/12/02, J. Nagy
  1. Fixed bug in Classes/@psfMatrix/private/issymmetric.m

* 11/17/02, J. Nagy
  1. Fixed bug in Classes/@psfMatrix/private/reflexKronApprox.m
  2. Fixed bug in Classes/@psfMatrix/private/zeroKronApprox.m

* 11/20/06, J. Nagy
  1. Added new iterative codes, HyBR, written by Julianne Chung.
     These are for testing purposes only -- some modifications will
     be needed.
  2. Added new "new_svdPrec" that seems to work better than psfPrec
  3. Some additional cosmetic changes and a few minor bugs have been
     fixed.
  4. Kronecker product codes have been updated using those developed
     from Lisa Perrone's thesis work.
  5. Made default boundary condition for psfMatrix to be reflexive.

* 3/22/06, J. Nagy
  1. Updated HyBR codes written by Julianne Chung.
     (see Examples/ for sample runs).
  2. Significant changes made to psfPrec:
      - old version only implemented BCCB (FFT-based) preconditioner.
      - new version determines from the PSF an appropriate basis,
        choosing from FFT, DCT, and Kronecker product SVD.
      - old version of preconditioner has been renamed fftPrec
  3. psfMatrix/mtimes
     Bug fix suggested by Tom Bishop.
     (Needed when using Tikhonov Regularization)
  4. fftPrec/private/circEig
     Got rid of scaling of PSF as suggested by Tom Bishop.
  5. psfMatrix/onePsfMatrix
     Got rid of PSF normalization -- leave that to user.
     (bug found by Martin Hanke)
