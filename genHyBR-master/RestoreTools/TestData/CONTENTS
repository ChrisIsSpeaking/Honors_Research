This directory contains a variety of test data.  Notation
is as follows:

  x_true : denotes the true image, if it is known.
  PSF    : image of the point spread function.  If spatially variant blur,
           then this is a cell array containing several PSFs.
  b      : blurred and noisy image.
  b_true : noise free blurred image, if it is known.

Following is some specific information about the data files:

  * Text.mat
    Contains data of some text.  The true image is in Matlab's image
    processing toolbox.  The PSF was generated using psfGauss.m,
    and is therefore a separable Gaussian blur.  This means one can
    use direct methods such as TSVD to restore the image.

  * satellite.mat
    This is the famous satellite data used as test data by many
    researchers in image processing.  The data came originally from the
    Air Force Research Laboratory as part of a simulation study of
    numerical methods for post processing images taken through atmospheric
    turbulence. The true image is known.

  * star_cluster.mat 
    This is data comes from the original Hubble Space Telescope; see
    http://www.stsci.edu/resources/  for more information and other data.
    The data is not ill-conditioned, but it is a good example of a 
    spatially variant blur.  One can use 1, 4, or 25 PSFs to restore
    the image.  The true image is known.

  * psfGauss.m
    The function psfGauss.m can be used to create a Gaussian PSF.
    Use "help psfGauss" for more information.
