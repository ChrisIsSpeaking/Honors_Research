             =================================
                 RestoreTools, Version 1.4
                    (No IP Toolbox)
             =================================

Use this version if Matlab's Image Processing Toolbox is not available.
We recommend using the Image Processing Toolbox if possible.

This version contains a new psfPrec that is based on an approximate
SVD of the psfMatrix.  In most cases it performs much better than
the old version, which has been renamed fftPrec.

This version also contains a new iterative method, HyBR, written by
Julianne Chung.  This is a very powerful Lanczos based hybrid method
that will automatically choose (Tikhonov) regularization parameters,
and automatically determine a stopping iteration.  Default parameters,
tolerances, etc., can be changed with the HyBRset function.

"RestoreTools" is an object oriented Matlab implementation of
algorithms that can be used for image restoration problems.  Some
examples illustrating how to use this package can be found in the
directory ./Examples

This current version, 1.s, can be used for iterative image restoration
methods.  Direct methods TSVD and Tikhonov can also be used.

The principal developers of the code are:

   James Nagy and his students, including Lisa Perrone, Katrina Palmer,
   and Julianne Chung.
   
    Emory University
    Atlanta Georgia, USA

This software has been developed as a pedagogical and research tool, 
and is provided "as is", without any warranty of any kind.
