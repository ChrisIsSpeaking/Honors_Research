The original version of RestoreTools required the following
functions from Matlab's Image Processing Toolbox:

   dct2
   idct2
   padarray (and mkconstarray)

At the Householder meeting in Peebles, Scotland, 
May 17--21, we requested, and received permission from 
Cleve Moler, to make copies of these functions 
from the Image Processing Toolbox.

The ParseInputs function in padarray had several Image
Processing Toolbox dependencies, so we modified it a bit.
